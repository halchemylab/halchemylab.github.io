        This Power BI project tells a story about webinar performance and its
        impact on high-level decision-making. As a powerful visualization tool,
        Power BI allowed me to transform raw data into actionable insights,
        despite its integration limitations on the web.

        The process began with meticulous data cleaning and preparation, where I
        integrated multiple datasets into a unified source of truth. Using Power
        BI, I connected these datasets, created meaningful relationships, and
        built dashboards that balanced design and functionality. This included
        interactive filters, detailed drilldowns, and clear visualizations such
        as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.

        Each dashboard was designed with the end user in mind, delivering
        insights that empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. This
        project showcases my expertise in Power BI, from data preparation to
        crafting impactful visual narratives, and demonstrates my ability to
        create solutions that inform and inspire action.
