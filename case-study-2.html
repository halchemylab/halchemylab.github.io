      <p>
        For this project, I downloaded my sleep data from Google Fit and used
        the json file to generate different graphs to analyze my sleep pattersn.
        The four types of graphs I chose were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Line plot: Sleep duration over time</li>
        <li>Box plot: Sleep duration by day</li>
        <li>Histogram: Sleep duration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this report, I will present my findings and discuss any external
        factors that may be affecting my sleep patterns.

      <h3 class="section-title">Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        To conduct the analysis, I first downloaded my sleep data from Google
        Fit online as a json file. I then used Python to clean the data and
        generate the different graphs. The sleep duration data was cleaned by
        removing any entries with missing values or outliers. The sleep data was
        then split by day of the week and analyzed using the different graphs.
      </p>
      <p>The four graphs used to analyze my sleep data are explained below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Line plot: Sleep duration over time - This plot shows the trend of my
          sleep duration over time. It allows me to identify any long-term
          trends in my sleep patterns, such as changes in sleep duration over
          different seasons.
        </li>

          alt="Sleep Duration Over Time"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
        />

        <li>
          Box plot: Sleep duration by day - This plot shows the distribution of
          my sleep duration by day of the week. It allows me to identify any
          consistent patterns in my sleep duration, such as sleeping more on
          weekends.
        </li>
        <img
          src="assets/img/folio/Sleep Duration By Day.png"
          alt="Sleep Duration By Day"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
        />

        <li>
          Histogram: Sleep duration - This plot shows the frequency of different
          sleep durations. It allows me to identify the most common sleep
          duration and the distribution of sleep duration data.
        </li>
        <img
          src="assets/img/folio/Distribution of Sleep.png"
          alt="Distribution of Sleep"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
        />

      <h3 class="section-title">Findings</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the observations from the different graphs, it appears that I
        generally get between 4-8 hours of sleep per night, with occasional
        outliers where I sleep for longer periods of time. There is a consistent
        pattern of getting more sleep on Saturdays, with Sunday and Thursday
        also being relatively consistent days for sleep. The distribution of
        sleep durations appears to be negatively skewed, with the highest count
        of sleep durations at 8 hours, followed by 6 hours, 2 hours, and 11
        hours. There is no clear correlation between bedtime and sleep duration,
        as indicated by the scatter plot.

      <h3 class="section-title">Discussion</h3>
      <p>
        External factors during this time period that may be affecting my sleep
        patterns could include depression, constant computer use, and a
        sedentary lifestyle. These factors can have a negative impact on sleep
        quality and duration, and may be contributing to the observed patterns
        in the data. It may be helpful to address these factors in order to
        improve sleep quality and duration.

      <p>
        In conclusion, the analysis of my sleep data reveals some interesting
        patterns in my sleep patterns. By identifying the most common sleep
        duration and the distribution of sleep duration data, I can make
        informed decisions about my sleep habits and take steps to improve my
        sleep quality and duration.
